# SF Foodtruck Finder

To use this as a command line program, make sure current folder is /src, and run: 
```
javac -cp ../lib/jackson-core-2.9.7.jar:../lib/jackson-databind-2.9.7.jar:../lib/jackson-annotations-2.9.7.jar FoodTruckFinder.java FoodTruck.java
java -cp .:../lib/jackson-core-2.9.7.jar:../lib/jackson-databind-2.9.7.jar:../lib/jackson-annotations-2.9.7.jar FoodTruckFinder
```
This program is used to get current open food trucks using San Francisco governmentâ€™s API. 

User could see 10 trucks per single ENTER prompt based on current date/time. 

The program use lazy fetch mechanism by calling api using "limit=?" and "offset=?" to make sure the data is fetched only by user request. Further more, the result page is trimmed for exact 10 results every time. Since not all the result returned by API are going to be valid, if not valid, fetch more until the size is achieved. 

For a command line program, it's a fetch-as-needed single thread solution and not involved with local database.

If it's going to be used for a full scale web application, data would be needed to store in a local database or cache for multiple "GET"(read) requests and avoid calling API multiple times. So I would call it fetch-and-store solution. The focus would be more on how to synchronize the database with live data with a "window". The size of the window could be daily, weekly, monthly based on local database storage. Accordingly, update the database every day/week/month.
